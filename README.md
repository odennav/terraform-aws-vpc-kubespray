##  Provision VPC in AWS & Deploy a Kubernetes Cluster  

This project uses Terraform to deploy a 3-Tier Architecture on AWS which consists of the following:

- Virtual Private Cloud

- Private, public and database subnets.

- Bastion, private and database EC2 instances.

- Internet gateway for Bastion EC2 instances.

- NAT gateway for private EC2 instances to communicate with the internet.

- Elastic IPs assigned for NAT gateways.

No routes created from NAT gateway to database instances.

### Requirements

- Install [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install)

- Install [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

- Generate key pair for connection to EC2 instances in AWS console. Name it `terraform-key`. Choose `RSA` key pair type and use `.pem` key file format.

- Minimum required version of Kubernetes is **`v1.27`**

Shell scripts used to automate deployment of kubernetes cluster to private EC2 instances with kubespray.

Inventory list for ansible is dynamically built with `.tpl` template.


### Getting Started


Clone this repository to local machine
```bash
cd /
git clone git@github.com:odennav/terraform-aws-vpc-kubespray.git
cd terraform-kubernetes-aws-vpc-kubespray/terraform
```


Implement terraform commands sequentially in local machine to create the AWS infrastructure.

Initialize terraform working directory

```bash
terraform init
```

Validate the syntax of the terraform configuration files
```bash
terraform validate
```

Create an execution plan that describes the changes terraform will make to the infrastructure
```bash
terraform plan
```

Apply the changes described in execution plan
```bash
terraform apply -auto-approve
```
Check AWS console for instances created and running

-----
   
Use the `.pem` key from AWS to SSH into the public EC2 instance.

IPv4 address of public EC2 instance will be shown in terraform outputs.
```bash
ssh -i private-key/terraform-key.pem ec2-user@<ipaddress>
```
Its possible to use public EC2 instance as a jumpbox to ssh into private EC2 instances within the VPC.

Change root password upon first-Login to `dev-Control` machine
```bash
sudo passwd
```

Switch to root user.

Add new user to sudo group. In this case new user is `odennav-admin`
```bash
sudo useradd odennav-admin
sudo usermod -aG wheel odennav-admin
```

Test sudo privileges by switching to new user
```bash
su - odennav-admin
sudo ls /root
```

You'll notice prompt to enter your user password.

To disable this prompt for every sudo command, implement the following:

Add sudoers file for `odennav-admin` user
```bash
cd /etc/sudoers.d/
sudo echo "odennav-admin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" > odennav-admin
```
Set permissions for sudoers file
```bash
sudo chmod 0440 odennav-admin
```

Update yum package manager
```bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum upgrade -y
```

Confirm Git was installed by terraform
```bash
git --version
```

Confirm terraform-key was transferred to public EC2 instance by null provisioner
   
`terraform-key.pem` should be copied to another folder because it will be deleted if node is restarted or shutdown
```bash
ls -la /tmp/terraform-key.pem
cp /tmp/terraform-key.pem /
```

Change permissions of terraform-key.pem file
   
SSH test will fail if permissions of `.pem` key are not secure enough
```bash
sudo chmod 400 /tmp/terraform-key.pem
```


Clone this repository to `control-dev` node
```bash
cd /
git clone git@github.com:odennav/terraform-aws-vpc-kubespray.git
git clone git@github.com:kubernetes-sigs/kubespray.git
```

Copy IPv4 adresses of private EC2 instances deployed by Terraform
   
Check IPv4 addresses in `inventory` file and input them in `bash-scripts/ipaddr-list.txt`
   
Don't change format seen in `.txt` file, ip addresses will be read by the shell scripts.
   
For security reasons, don't share your private ips. 

-----

Install yum and python utilities

```bash
sudo chmod 770 dependencies-install
sudo ./dependencies-install
```

Setup nodes for Kubernetes cluster
    
```bash
sudo chmod 770 kubespray-deploy.sh
sudo ./kubespray-env-build.sh
```
   
Change directory to your local kubespray repository and execute the ansilbe playbook to deploy kubernetes cluster with kubespray
   
```bash
cd /kubespray
ansible-playbook -i inventory/mycluster/hosts.yaml --become --become-user=odennav-admin cluster.yml
```

-----

#### Destroying Resources(Optional)

To tear down the infrastructure created by Terraform.

```bash
terraform destroy
```

Enjoy!
